As a designer she is very detail-oriented and she  can provide constructive and valuable feedback on visual design as well, which is a real plus in our industry.  Dawa can produce very accurate wireframes, white board exercises and give advice on the final output. Her  strengths are definitely precision, attention to details, passion for the product and managerial skills.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Fabio Benedetti, worked directly with Dawa at Alfresco  \"\"Dawa was a member of our sprint team and she made invaluable contributions to the UX design of our  current and future android products.

She will be missed.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Jim Granger, managed Dawa at Intel Corporation  \"\"I had the esteemed privilege to work with Dawa on a complicated workflow web app for our company  CrossCurrent. Being a primary developer on the project it was an absolute dream to have a designer as  thoughtful, talented and easy to work with as Dawa. The design principles she came up with were thorough  and her wireframes were impeccably presented. What I appreciated about Dawa was that she was very  approachable and some of my best and easiest work was developing side by side with her giving tips and    Page7    recommendations as I went. I believe that the strength of our product was much improved by her work, and  would gladly recommend her to anyone seeking a highly qualified, professional UI/UX designer.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Jesse Stromwick, worked directly with Dawa at CrossCurrent, Inc.  \"\"Dawa is a highly competent user experience designer with strong expertise in mobile and responsive design.  She brought valuable insight to the SapientNitro UX team at Vodafone UK where she worked on the mobile  \\'Help & Support\\' section of the website.

I recommend her without hesitation!\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Dominic Winsor, managed Dawa indirectly at Vodafone - Sapient Nitro  \"\"Dawa and I worked together on a web user survey study for MTV\\'s video on demand service. Dawa was  responsible for designing the survey, collecting the data, carrying out statistical analysis on the user data  and creating detailed finding reports.

If you are looking for a competent designer who knows their craft and  can deliver - you\\'ll be well served speaking with Dawa.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Dan Cooney, was Dawa\\'s client  \"\"Dawa was a real joy to work, both as a Sr Information Architect and Interaction Architect on a large number  of complex engagements. She brought deep and broad senior-level UX skillsets to each project, as well as an  intimate knowledge as to the technical feasibility of what was being designed due to her hardcore background  as a developer, too. We worked together on projects that spanned extremely creative/edgy/marketing-focused  to complex, interaction-based web-based apps for the general public (the largest credit card company in the  world). She was pivotal in spear-heading a complete re-design of an extremely complex, internal-facing, webbased app for insurance and annuities groups of a Fortune 100 client, including extensive field user research  Page8    of financial advisers/brokers as insights into the new user-centric design that we proposed and built.

Dawa picked up on the financial information for retirement plans  right away, and took a leading role in designing the interactions and data displays for one of the major site  sections. Dawa completed most of her work independently without the need for much guidance. She could  always be relied on to have her work completed on time, and with the extra thought put in to deliver more  than what was asked for. Dawa\\'s work was well received all around, and I can only recommend her for any  future projects.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Martin Kas, managed Dawa at Avenue A Razorfish  \"\"My first impression of Dawa was of our portfolio review when she came in to interview. With no trace of  hesitation, she showed both her finished work alongside several hand-drawn wireframes and prints which she  had annotated by hand. I could quickly tell that she would be able to create a finished product, but was also  able to cogently discuss her thoughts using whatever medium was around. In other words, she is a designer  who can quickly make her point.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Erik Gibb, managed Dawa indirectly at Modem Media/Digitas Inc./Publicis  \"\"Dawa was the UI/UX lead developer and designer at SDO.

Jensen Project Justification    Page 2 of 2    Looking at Bradleys achievements, its hard to believe his phone wasnt ringing off the  hook. But his original r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9 was a five-page data dump that made the reader really  work to figure how what hed done.  Part of his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproblem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was that he was good at just about every aspect of senior  management, so defining a brand and honing in on the most relevant achievements was  a challenge. I embraced his multiple talents as assets and positioned him a leader who  delivers bottom-line growth by improving every aspect of business from Sales to  Operations to HR. I built a branding statement and brief introductory profile to set the  expectations of the reader accordingly.    Rather than trying to include all of his accomplishments, I honed in on representative  projects from each of his areas of strength, creating mini case studies that provide insight  into Bradleys management style and proof of his effectiveness. One of his  accomplishments, saving $30M per year in delivery model operations, became a simple  graph that tells an immediate story to the reader.  I wanted to take advantage of Bradleys stellar early career performance as an executive  at a major bank without risking age discrimination. So I created an Early Career  Summary without dates.  Bradleys new resume generated a lot of interest. He landed a General Manager position  within three months at a premier HR services firm.\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[42, 59, "Name"], [63, 75, "Location"], [106, 123, "Email Address"], [127, 143, "Designation"], [153, 184, "Designation"], [353, 376, "Years of Experience"], [1041, 1059, "Companies worked at"], [1061, 1073, "Location"], [1074, 1086, "Years of Experience"], [1165, 1169, "Location"], [1175, 1179, "Location"], [1226, 1262, "Designation"], [1401, 1405, "Location"], [1410, 1415, "Location"], [1518, 1535, "Name"], [1583, 1601, "Email Address"], [2762, 2778, "Location"], [2889, 2907, "Companies worked at"], [2922, 2947, "Designation"], [3128, 3140, "Years of Experience"], [3348, 3379, "Companies worked at"], [3381, 3393, "Location"], [3508, 3547, "Designation"], [3548, 3562, "Years of Experience"], [4540, 4595, "Designation"], [4596, 4611, "Years of Experience"], [4696, 4726, "Designation"], [4728, 4746, "Location"], [4747, 4762, "Years of Experience"], [4766, 4778, "Years of Experience"], [4782, 4799, "Name"], [4847, 4865, "Email Address"], [5044, 5102, "Designation"], [5103, 5118, "Years of Experience"], [5290, 5300, "Designation"], [5302, 5320, "Designation"], [5327, 5337, "Designation"], [5349, 5372, "Designation"], [5377, 5386, "Companies worked at"], [5387, 5414, "Location"], [5651, 5654, "Degree"], [5656, 5677, "Degree"], [5679, 5700, "College Name"], [5702, 5706, "Graduation Year"], [5708, 5731, "Degree"], [5733, 5754, "College Name"], [5756, 5760, "Graduation Year"], [5764, 5781, "Name"], [6390, 6395, "Designation"], [6400, 6410, "Designation"], [6414, 6416, "Designation"], [7183, 7198, "Designation"], [196, 214, "Job Specific Skills"], [216, 236, "Job Specific Skills"], [242, 259, "Job Specific Skills"], [321, 330, "Soft Skills"], [332, 340, "Soft Skills"], [341, 347, "Soft Skills"], [706, 744, "Job Specific Skills"], [752, 767, "Job Specific Skills"], [768, 782, "Job Specific Skills"], [786, 795, "Job Specific Skills"], [798, 830, "Job Specific Skills"], [831, 852, "Job Specific Skills"], [860, 871, "Job Specific Skills"], [872, 890, "Job Specific Skills"], [892, 902, "Job Specific Skills"], [925, 944, "Job Specific Skills"], [946, 980, "Job Specific Skills"], [983, 998, "Job Specific Skills"], [1002, 1011, "Job Specific Skills"], [1768, 1798, "Job Specific Skills"], [3807, 3847, "Job Specific Skills"]]}

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE    BANK OF AMERICA, New York, NY    2014-2015    Software Developer      6 month consulting position working in core Python development in the Quartz core team.        Developed a tool for detecting anomalous trading events and displaying them to auditors.        Developing an Excel replacement for end-user computing.    AMERICAN MEDIA INC. (AMI), New York, NY    2014    Software Architect/Engineer      This was a week-to-week consulting contract for system design, Scala and Python programming.        Enhanced a set of web services providing a proprietary back end for AMI\\'s in-progress content  management system. The system is written in Scala and needed a set of extensions for both the  ingestion and retrieval systems.        Designed an improvement to AMI\\'s proprietary search engine to prevent it from returning links to  properties that were not available to the user performing the search.        Wrote functional tests in Python using AMI\\'s proprietary connection library.    HELIOS    &    MATHESON,    MPHASIS, New York, NY (subsidiary of HEWLETT PACKARD)    New    York,    NY  2014    Ontologist      This was a 3-month contract with MphasiS. Helios & Matheson was the W-2 employer but had no  influence over the work.        Designed an ontology representing a catalog for electrical products as a proof of concept. The  ultimate client was Schneider Electric, a multinational company, on behalf of their Australian  subsidiary Clipsal.        Wrote SPARQL queries used by a generic Web application so that new product hierarchies, userspecific displays of details, and user-defined ideas of product similarity could be added to the  application solely by changing the ontology, with no programming modifications.    LEXISNEXIS, New York, NY    2010  2014    Senior Content Architect / Ontologist      Designed a schema in RELAX NG and XML Schema for government agency documents.        Designed and documented modular entity schemas that specify the standard LexisNexis  representations of information about judges, legislatures, expert witnesses, and commercial  organizations. These schemas were delivered in three variants: for editorial use, for the master  repository, and for the internal document bus. Reviewed and updated modules written by other team  members, and led the reviews of my own modules.        Enhanced a widely used schema module for legal citations to handle cases where text explaining the  purpose of the citation appears in separate sections of a document).        Wrote and supported several internal tools for crude XML analysis, generating \"\"version 0\"\" schemas  reflecting what is actually present in large samples of existing documents (up to a million documents  per run).        Rewrote the internal schema used by the content team to document our schemas.        Led the development team for the Lexis Content Ontology, a high-visibility, high-pressure, loosely  specified project with a hard deadline for its first version. Learned essentially from scratch the  principles of ontology design, how to convert logical data models from PowerDesigner, and the  Prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 OWL editor.        Delivered six major sub-ontologies based on the entity schema modules and data models,  contributed to all other sub-ontologies, and reviewed all team results, making possible the on-time  delivery of the ontology.        Developed a strategy for migrating all schema development source control from the LexisNexis  legacy system (IBM ClearCase) to Subversion. Identified platform requirements, wrote installation  and migration plans, and communicated strategy to the architecture team. Supported the migration  effort by assisting the other team members with conversion to the new style. The new system has  been essentially problem-free for over a year. Another LexisNexis team has converted to Subversion  following the plans I wrote.        Updated the schemas and conversion instructions for business directories and news items to handle  non-U.S. sources.        Implemented a continuous-build server for schemas analogous to those used for code.    2007  2010    GOOGLE, New York, NY  Developer Advocate (Internal) (2009  2010)      Led Google Data API orientation, design review, code review, pre-launch, and new technology  evangelism meetings, as well as answering one-off questions, for about 25 Google service teams,  including Google Book Search, Calendar, Contacts, Spreadsheets, and Webmaster Tools.

Also much time was required to port ABB  applications to APIs that were not completely POSIX compliant and it increased the reliance on  single vendor. All these problems could be overcome by using an open source OS like linux  while still maintaining the real time constraints using preempt_rt patch. This was a research  project that studied the properties of preempt_rt patched Linux in real world scenarios and  decided on worst case timings that will satisfy requirements in ABBs robotic applications    Project  Name  Role  Client  Duration  Work Location  Description    Description  CCPU  Software Developer  NOATM  July 2009  Bangalore  This project involved putting realtime embedded Linux on the MPC5200 based CCPU board.

Such porting does not provide any value  addition to ABB robotics and yet increases time to market.

Assistant Professor/Director of Transition and Employment Center, Kent State U., Kent, OH,  1989-95  Associate Professor, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, 1995-Present    V.    Brief Work History    My involvement in the fields of SPED and REHAB extends back to the early 1970\\'s.  While an undergraduate student, I was employed as a drug rehabilitation and crisis intervention  counselor and I volunteered as a cub-scout master for a troop that integrated youth with  disabilities into the general troop. My work while achieving my M.Ed. and Ed.S., involved the  development and delivery of habilitation and educational services to person with developmental  disabilities. During that period I was a teacher, a director of a community educational program,  and performed research and demonstration activities at Kent State University. While in  Kentucky, I worked towards developing integrated and \"\"state of the art\"\" educational and  rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities. Further, I spent two years attempting to assist  persons with disabilities accessing appropriate employment outcomes. Upon returning to Ohio, I  worked with adults that had a college education, to access meaningful and appropriate  employment. In my role as Associate Director and Assistant Professor, my efforts focused on  systematically address education, employment, and transitional issues for persons with the full  range of disabilities. With my return to Kentucky as an Associate Professor of Special  Education, my focus has continued be on transition and employment issues for youth and adults  with disabilities. I have participated in a wide range of transition programs that include  consulting on two educational systems change grants (Kentuckys Transition Systems Change  Project and Kentuckys Severe Systems Change Project). Further, in Kentucky, I have directed  numerous state and federally funded demonstration and research grants in transition and  employment. I consult with the Kentucky Board of Education and the Kentucky Association of  School Boards on a variety of education issues. Until the summer of 2002 I was coordinator of  Kentuckys State Improvement Grant in Special Education (a federal grant designed to improve  special education services throughout the state). Since then, I have directed the special education  and distance education programs in special education, overseen numerous grants and projects,  and taught coursework in special education.

William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (2006-2007)  Summary of Research and Scholarship:  I am a sociologist of higher education. Through research, writing, and teaching, I have contributed to our  understanding of major changes in the academic landscape and organizational character of American higher  education. My work illuminates the dynamics of institutional change in several arenas\\xe2\\x80\\x94what facilitates it and  what impedes it within different types of colleges and universities\\xe2\\x80\\x94and identifies implications for academic  leaders who manage organizational change, knowledge change and professional socialization. Using theories  and methods from sociology, I analyze how organizational, intellectual, political, economic, and professional  interests redefine the content, structure, conduct, and relative legitimacy of academic fields.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Key studies include: the emergence and institutionalization of interdisciplinary fields; dynamics of  professional socialization across disciplines; tensions in restructuring during budget cuts and selective  investment; the ascendance of industry logic in public higher education (1975-2000), a pivotal era of  changing societal expectations; forces that promote and inhibit academic collaboration.  Serving in academic leadership roles has affirmed my passion for these areas and has inspired new inquiry in  graduate education, leadership development, academic collaboration, and organizational change.  2    PUBLICATIONS  Books  Gumport, P.

Current Research:  American Government: Democracy in Transition (Pearson, under contract)  This book examines the American political system and its institutions as we transform from a  democracy of self-interest to one of increasing transparency and evidence-based decision  making. The book is designed for introductory American Government courses, and therefore  covers, in depth, the framers, constitutional theory, institutions, and participation  while  simultaneously engaging with a student population who may be only vaguely interested in  government.  Linking Science to Decision Making in Environmental Policy: Bridging the Disciplinary Gap (coauthored with Lawrence Becker, The MIT Press, under contract)  This book examines the role of science in moderating interest-based politics in resource  management and environmental stewardship. The manuscript builds a model of science based  policy processes where management decisions are based on stakeholder input but constrained  by scientific efficacy. Ultimately, the project is intended to develop a protocol to maximize crossdisciplinary decision making in environmental policy.  Environmental Deceptions: The Tension between Liberalism and Environmental Policymaking in  the United States (with Kristy Michaud; Albany: State University of New York Press, 2nd edition  under contract)  This book brings together normative analyses and empirical data to explain the structural  limitations liberal society places on environmental improvement. I argue that cultural  ambivalence toward communitarian ethics has made the traditional environmental  infrastructure problematic. The book exposes the subtle tensions that often lead to policy  failure, and suggests that traditional policy models are insufficient to resolve existing  environmental dilemmas in air, water, waste, and energy.

Clients  include Siemens, General Electric (GE), Chevron-Texaco, John Deere3M,  Honeywell-Tensor, Ingersoll-Rand, South African Large Telescope (SALT),  National Instruments, and numerous medium and small firms.    A few sample projects include:      John Deere - Software and Hardware development and integration of  full-body vehicle simulator. For this project, done in conjunction with  Chevron-Oronite, I was responsible for leading a team of engineers to  develop several a showcase tradeshow displays, including a Gator and  Tractor Simulator that integrated a real John Deere tractor for attendees to sit  on while they \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdrove\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it through a videogame simulation, where the pitch, roll,  vibrations, and even air temperature were recreated physically to match the  virtual world. Using a closed-loop control system, users would experience the  mechanical effects of various oils. Combining the marketing appeal of a  Disney ride with sophisticated hardware systems, we used LabVIEW to  program the control system, Unity-3D to write the animation fly-through,  integrated the hardware system, and did extensive testing.        Chevron  Engine \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPilot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d simulator. Similar to the previous project, I was  the architect of a motion simulator system that allowed users to fly through  the inside of a diesel engine, and experience the effects of heat, oils, and  various fuel combinations while going for a thrill ride.

Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a  great place to start when composing your resume. This list is a sampling of the types of  skills you might highlight on your resume, in addition to those skills that are more  specific to your major, intended industry, or job function.  A sampling of action verbs is also included on this page. Be sure to use strong action  verbs to begin each of your bulleted statements, previewing the skill to be exemplified  through the accomplishment statement.    IV.

Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements  under each position. This resume type is recommended for people who have recently  graduated with a bachelors degree, those who are staying within the same career field,  and candidates with few time gaps in their job history. This type is most often preferred  by employers because it is easy to scan, highlights job titles, employers, and dates, and  clearly ties candidates skills and accomplishments to their work histories.

Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight  transferable skills, placing less emphasis on employment dates, job titles, and  employers.    VI.

Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics  The purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience,  and skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume,  think of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect  candidate for the opportunity at hand.  Resume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best  practices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content  and a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with  regard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify  the skills you possess and employers are seeking.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should  keep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing  elements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the readers eye to rest.  Using .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A  10-12 point font size is recommended.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold  a job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers,  dates, etc. line up neatly on the page.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully  read through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least  2-3 people proofread it as well.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when  you have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties,  quantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry  or job function-specific) and transferable skills.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the  skill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily  scan your resume for what he or she is seeking.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the beginning of each bullet point as this is  assumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy duties included...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy responsibilities  were\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking.  Also, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your  most important information stands out.    3    II. Key Elements of a Successful Resume  Your First and Last Name  \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Phone number \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Email address \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Street address \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 City, state & zip code \\xe2\\x99\\xa6  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  OBJECTIVE  Create a statement describing or naming the position you are seeking to obtain. You may also include the specific field or area  you are interested in and the skills and expertise you could contribute to the company. This section is optional and could be  omitted or substituted with a \\xe2\\x80\\x95Career Highlights\\xe2\\x80\\x96 or \\xe2\\x80\\x95Summary of Qualifications\\xe2\\x80\\x96 section.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  EDUCATION  Institution City, State  (Expected) Graduation Month Year  Write out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations  GPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher)  Other possible information to include: Study Abroad experiences, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  TECHNICAL SKILLS   Utilities   Languages   Software   Databases   Hardware  _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  EXPERIENCE, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE [possible titles/descriptive headings]  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year   The position header above is one example of formatting. Other formats can include using two lines or rearranging the order of  the Organization, Job Title, Location, and Dates to emphasize the most important elements.   You can bold or italicize your title or your organization\\xe2\\x80\\x94whichever is more relevant, but be consistent.   In this section include bulleted accomplishment statements, which provide examples of times you have successfully used the  skills employers are seeking.   Start with a strong action verb, then follow with an explanation of what you were doing, describe how you did it, and, when  possible, include any outcomes that you achieved. Remember, statements should ultimately convey your proficiency in one or  more skill sets of interest to the employer by way of providing an example of when you have used them.   Consider the following questions to help you create more effective bullet points: What was the result/outcome of your work?  What were your accomplishments? How did you help the organization? What skills/knowledge did you enhance? How does  this experience relate to your internship/employment goal?  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year   Bulleted statements should be in the proper tense (past or present tense) and use consistent grammar and punctuation.   Be specific by including quantity, frequency, population, and impact of your work whenever possible.   Make sure your resume is easy to read and not too text heavy. Avoid using colors, multiple fonts, pictures, being too brief, or  making it too dense. Make it your own, but be professional.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE, LEADERSHIP, HONORS, ACTIVITIES, COMMUNITY SERVICE, VOLUNTEER,  PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT [possible titles/descriptive headings]  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year   Using multiple experience sections is optional and allows you to emphasize (by placing it closer to the top) your most relevant  experience. Experiences within a section should be listed in reverse chronological order.   Positions within this section should be formatted like previous experience sections, but may or may not include bullet points.   In an additional experience section, you can include work experiences that may not be directly related to the job you are  applying to, but add to your credibility by exemplifying a progressive work history.   Emphasize your transferable skills, those that can be taken from one experience and applied elsewhere.  Organization, Your Role (e.g. Member, Participant, Honoree, or Presenter)  City, State Month Year - Month Year   This section can also be an opportunity to share your experiences as a leader, honors received, community involvement,  professional development activities, or membership in organizations. As illustrated, replace \\xe2\\x80\\x95job title\\xe2\\x80\\x96 with the role you played.    4    III. Transferable Skills & Action Verbs  TRANSFERABLE SKILLS  Transferable skills are those that can be applied in multiple work settings. Consider incorporating them, in addition to those  that are specific to your intended career field, by providing examples of when you have successfully used them in your bulleted accomplishment statements. Some examples of transferable skills include the following:  CLERICAL  Bookkeeping  Classifying  Collecting  Compiling  Computing  Examining  Filing  Organizing  Recording  Word processing    PROBLEM SOLVING  Analyzing  Appraising  Diagnosing  Examining  Executing  Planning  Proving  Reasoning  Recognizing  Validating    TECHNICAL  Adjusting  Aligning  Assembling  Drafting  Engineering  Installing  Observing  Operating  Programming  Repairing    CREATIVE  Designing  Developing  Establishing  Illustrating  Imagining  Improvising  Inventing  performing  Revitalizing  Visualizing    RESEARCH  Assessing  Calculating  Collecting  Diagnosing  Evaluating  Examining  Extrapolating  Interviewing  Investigating  Synthesizing    TRAINING  Adapting  Communicating  Demonstrating  Enabling  Encouraging  Evaluating  Explaining  Instructing  Planning  Stimulating    ACTION VERBS  Beginning each bulleted accomplishment statement with a strong action verb helps to highlight your successes and allows a  reader to get a sense of your skills by scanning the page prior to reading each individual bullet point. It is a good idea to vary  the action verbs on your resume in order to appeal to different audiences. Below is a list of verbs to help get you started.

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based\napplications on a given network.\n• WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt\n\n\n\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\n• The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized\n• Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform\ncheck.\n\nPRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)\n\nEDUCATION\n\nB.E in CSE\n\nANNA University\n\n2011\n\nDay Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\n\n2005 to 2007\n\nSKILLS\n\noptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTechnical Skills\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 25, "Name"], [26, 39, "Designation"], [42, 71, "Companies worked at"], [73, 87, "Location"], [110, 166, "Email Address"], [1136, 1149, "Designation"], [1152, 1187, "Companies worked at"], [1191, 1216, "Years of Experience"], [1227, 1247, "Years of Experience"], [3456, 3478, "Designation"], [3520, 3549, "Years of Experience"], [5609, 5626, "Designation"], [5654, 5680, "Years of Experience"], [7652, 7655, "Degree"], [7659, 7679, "College Name"], [7679, 7685, "Graduation Year"], [3560, 3586, "Years of Experience"], [170, 191, "Years of Experience"], [195, 216, "Job Specific Skills"], [218, 228, "Job Specific Skills"], [230, 240, "Job Specific Skills"], [286, 304, "Tech Tools"], [310, 316, "Tech Tools"], [348, 355, "Tech Tools"], [357, 364, "Tech Tools"], [380, 388, "Tech Tools"], [393, 416, "Job Specific Skills"], [423, 429, "Tech Tools"], [457, 475, "Job Specific Skills"], [634, 649, "Job Specific Skills"], [651, 657, "Tech Tools"], [676, 740, "Job Specific Skills"], [2680, 2699, "Job Specific Skills"], [2701, 2719, "Job Specific Skills"], [3481, 3501, "Job Specific Skills"], [3503, 3516, "Companies worked at"], [5629, 5649, "Job Specific Skills"], [6476, 6491, "Job Specific Skills"], [6555, 6585, "Job Specific Skills"], [7745, 7757, "Job Specific Skills"], [7769, 7775, "Tech Tools"], [7787, 7793, "Job Specific Skills"], [7805, 7808, "Tech Tools"], [7820, 7827, "Job Specific Skills"], [7902, 7908, "Tech Tools"], [7910, 7913, "Tech Tools"], [7915, 7926, "Tech Tools"], [7928, 7931, "Tech Tools"], [7933, 7948, "Tech Tools"], [7950, 7952, "Tech Tools"], [7974, 7997, "Job Specific Skills"], [7962, 7972, "Job Specific Skills"], [7999, 8013, "Job Specific Skills"], [8015, 8036, "Job Specific Skills"], [8038, 8052, "Job Specific Skills"], [8053, 8073, "Job Specific Skills"], [8074, 8101, "Tech Tools"], [8103, 8129, "Tech Tools"], [8170, 8177, "Tech Tools"], [8179, 8186, "Tech Tools"], [8188, 8193, "Tech Tools"], [8227, 8234, "Tech Tools"], [8235, 8240, "Tech Tools"], [8243, 8248, "Tech Tools"], [8250, 8262, "Job Specific Skills"], [8265, 8270, "Tech Tools"], [8272, 8290, "Job Specific Skills"], [8293, 8297, "Tech Tools"], [8311, 8315, "Tech Tools"], [8328, 8342, "Tech Tools"], [8344, 8355, "Tech Tools"], [8369, 8377, "Tech Tools"], [8378, 8406, "Job Specific Skills"], [8409, 8419, "Tech Tools"], [8421, 8445, "Job Specific Skills"], [8466, 8479, "Tech Tools"], [8481, 8486, "Tech Tools"]]}
